# A Bootloader in Assembly Language 

 Bootloader is a piece of program that runs before any operating system is running.
 It is used to boot other operating systems, usually each operating system has a set of bootloaders specific for it.
Bootloaders usually contain several ways to boot the OS kernel and also contain commands for debugging and/or modifying the kernel environment.

# Requirements

You need an assember that can convert your assembly instructions into raw binary format and an simulator to view.
I am using Nasm assember and Qemu simulator.

For Linux, type following commands to install nasm & qemu(Quick Emulator)

 **sudo apt-get install nasm && sudo apt-get install qemu qemu-system-x86_64**

For Windows,download them from following sites and install them.

http://www.nasm.us/
https://qemu.weilnetz.de/

# For Linux,Type following command to compile file

  **nasm -f bin hello_world.asm -o myos.bin**
  
# Once file is compiled successfully and myos.bin file is created, then run it in qemu. 

  **qemu-system-x86_64 myos.bin**
  
# Microsoft Windows

For windows, open nasm application, it will prompt a command at location where nasm is installed.
Perform same commands as performed for linux juts giving full file name path.
Consider i have file in C:\Users\Pritam\Documents\temp folder.

  **nasm.exe -f bin "C:\Users\Pritam\Documents\temp\hello_world.asm" 
                                                  -o "C:\Users\Pritam\Documents\temp\myos.bin"**
  
  and to run in qemu,
  
  **"C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe"  "C:\Users\Pritam\Documents\temp\myos.bin"**
  
where i have installed qemu.

Here i have created .bin file, but you can also create .iso file.

Once it successfully prints Hello World! then attach Secondary device/USB drive and boot .bin/.iso in it.
You can use dd command on linux or can use rufus software on windows.
Output of above program is
